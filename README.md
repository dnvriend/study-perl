# study-perl
A small study project on the Perl programming language

## running a script
Perl scripts can be run by giving the file an executable flag and having the
correct interpreter at the top.

hello.pl:

```
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Hello World!"
```

Bash:

```
chmod +x hello.pl
```

A perl script can also be run by passing the perl script as an argument to the
perl interpreter:

```
perl hello.pl
```
